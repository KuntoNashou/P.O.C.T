# P.O.C.T
POCT is an acronym for Python Osint Cybersecurity Tools. It's just few tools that i made how can get useful for cybersecurity or osint


POCT was made for helping people, not for attacking them. 
I will not be responsible in any way for the negative use of any of the POCT tools.



I start this project recently so it might have some issues if u find one or u want a new tool or u have a good idea you can tell me by message me.
